***Compilation of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming***

**Data Structures**
- [Stack](https://github.com/Dixboi/Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Stack) - a collection of elements that follows the **LIFO**(Last In First Out) principle where the **last** added element is the one that can be removed **first**.


**Algorithms**
- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Dixboi/Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms/Bubble%20Sort) - a sorting algorithm where each **pair** of **adjacent** elements is compared and will get **swapped** if not in order. This can be in ascending order or in descending order.

**Dynamic Programming**
- None(*yet*)
