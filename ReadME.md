***Compilation of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming***

**Data Structures**
- [Stack](https://github.com/Dixboi/Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Stack) - a collection of elements that follows the **LIFO**(Last In First Out) principle where the **last** added element is the one that can be removed **first**.
- [Queue](https://github.com/Dixboi/Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Data%20Structures/Queue) - a collection of elements that follows the **FIFO**(First in First Out) principle where the **first** added element is the **first** one to be removed and the **last** one to be added is the **last** one to be removed. 


**Algorithms**
- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Dixboi/Data-Stuctures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/Algorithms/Bubble%20Sort) - a sorting algorithm where each **pair** of **adjacent** elements is compared and will get **swapped** if not in order. This can be in **ascending** order or in **descending** order.

**Dynamic Programming**
- None(*yet*)
